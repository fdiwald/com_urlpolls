# com_urlpolls
A Joomla component for managing polls via personalized URLs

My use case: Send mails with an invitation to an event to your guests. Include personalized links for accepting and rejecting. The URLs for the links are generated by this component. When a guest receives the mail and clicks one of the links, his decision will be saved in the joomla database. You can now view the results and plan your event.
